I study digital media at the [Graduate Center, CUNY][gc]{:target="_blank"}. Currently I am working on two projects: one is a collaborative research on the history of South Korean internet and how this history relates to the shaping of the modern South Korean society, and the other is a [workshop series][cml]{:target="_blank"} aimed at providing interdisciplinary researchers with basic concepts of machine learning and encouraging a critical discussion around it. I'm also trying to learn to live code music.

Before this I studied at an [artist-run school about technology and art][sfpc]{:target="_blank"}; worked as researcher / coordinator in a [makerspace program][makinglab]{:target="_blank"} that was part of the 4th Anyang Public Art Project; and made a [video series][recandplaynet]{:target="_blank"} of live music performances in urban settings.
