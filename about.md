My name is Achim ("ah-cheem"). Right now I am working on a survey of recent developments in AI technology with regards to music creation, towards my master's thesis at the Graduate Center, CUNY; I am also compiling [machine learning-related resources for a critical and balanced understanding and usage][cml]{:target="_blank"}. I have worked on a [collaborative research on the history of the South Korean web][k-www]{:target="_blank"}, and started a new [project that explores the collective memories embodied in online communities][text-gen]{:target="_blank"}. 

Occasionally I [translate texts and speeches between Korean, English and French][translation]{:target="_blank"}. 

Before, I studied at the [School for Poetic Computation][sfpc]{:target="_blank"}; worked as researcher / coordinator in a [makerspace program within the 4th Anyang Public Art Project][makinglab]{:target="_blank"}; and made a [video series of live music performances in urban settings][recandplaynet]{:target="_blank"}.
